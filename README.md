## 📜 Overview
This repository provides an Optimal Transport (OT) based framework for heterogeneous multi-modal fusion embedding, specifically designed for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) analysis. This project focuses on analyzing MRI and PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

### 🔍 Key Features
- **Heterogeneous Multi-modal Fusion**: Combines diverse data sources for effective AD diagnostic analysis.
- **OT-based Embedding**: Uses Optimal Transport to align and merge different feature distributions.
- **ADNI Data Support**: Ready to process and analyze MRI and PET imaging data from ADNI.
- **Optimization in Progress**: Transitioning to JAX for faster training and better performance.
